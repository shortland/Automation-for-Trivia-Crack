<strike>This is currently pretty much a rough draft...

Anyone using this script will have difficulty in getting their 'account cookie', 'account id' and 'game ids' to fetch answers for... Updates to come!

Anyways, currently at its state, when those 3 details are fulfilled on user side, Executing the script will basically give you the answer to the question without you having to type in the question. Simply press "Enter" Key in command line (Terminal) and it'll fetch the question and give you the correct answer. 

Cool Tip: It turns out that "spinning the wheel" is not random at all, rather the server decides what question to give you, and what category it'll be in before you even spin in. Using this, this script takes the information and provides it to you. So you can view the question and answer via the script before viewing it on a time-limit in the app.
